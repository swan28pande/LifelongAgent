# 1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/timem.git
cd timem

# 3. Add upstream repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TiMEM-AI/timem.git
```

### 2. Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Create a feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or fix a bug
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 3. Development

- Follow [Code Standards](#code-standards)
- Add [Tests](#testing-requirements) for your code
- Update relevant [Documentation](#documentation-requirements)

### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Add changed files
git add .

# Commit (follow commit message convention)
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
```

**Commit Message Convention**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

<full description>

<closes issue>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation update
- `style`: Code formatting (doesn't affect code execution)
- `refactor`: Refactoring (neither new feature nor fix)
- `perf`: Performance optimization
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 6. Create Pull Request

## Development Environment Setup

### Python Version Requirements

TiMem supports Python 3.10+. We recommend using Python 3.13 for development.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio ruff pre-commit
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Manually run pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

## Code Standards

### Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for code checking and formatting:

```bash
# Check code
ruff check .

# Auto-fix
ruff check --fix .

# Format code
ruff format .
```

### Type Annotations

TiMem uses Python type annotations. All public functions and methods should have type annotations:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional

def generate_memory(
    user_id: str,
    expert_id: str,
    session_id: str,
    conversation: List[Dict[str, str]],
) -> Optional[Memory]:
    """Generate memory.

    Args:
        user_id: User ID
        expert_id: Expert ID
        session_id: Session ID
        conversation: Conversation list

    Returns:
        Generated memory object, or None if failed
    """
    ...
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Modules**: lowercase with underscores: `memory_generator.py`
- **Classes**: PascalCase: `MemoryGenerator`
- **Functions and methods**: lowercase with underscores: `generate_memory`
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE with underscores: `MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`
- **Private methods**: single underscore prefix: `_internal_method`

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def retrieve_memories(
    query: str,
    user_id: str,
    limit: int = 10,
) -> List[Memory]:
    """Retrieve memories based on query.

    Args:
        query: Query text
        user_id: User ID
        limit: Maximum number of memories to return

    Returns:
        List of retrieved memories

    Raises:
        ValueError: If query is empty
        DatabaseError: If database connection fails
    """
    ...
```

## Testing Requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_memory_generator.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_memory_generator.py::test_generate_memory

# With coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=timem --cov-report=html
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/              # Unit tests
├── integration/       # Integration tests
└── conftest.py        # pytest configuration
```

### Testing Standards

- Test files start with `test_`
- Test functions start with `test_`
- Use descriptive test names
- Each test should be independent
- Use fixtures to share test data

```python
import pytest

def test_memory_generation_with_valid_input():
    """Test memory generation with valid input."""
    # Arrange
    generator = MemoryGenerator()
    conversation = [...]

    # Act
    result = generator.generate_memory(...)

    # Assert
    assert result is not None
    assert result.title != ""
```
