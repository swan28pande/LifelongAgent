## 🎯 Choose Your Usage Method

### Self-Hosted (Open Source)

If you want full control of TiMem on your own server:

1. Read the [Deployment Guide](../DEPLOYMENT.md)
2. Check [Example Code](../examples/README.md)
3. Refer to the main [README](../README.md)

**Best for**:
- Complete data locality
- Customization and extensions
- Research and experimentation

### Cloud Service (Online)

If you want to use TiMem cloud service without deployment:

1. Read [Cloud Service Quick Start](../cloud-service/README.md#-quick-start)
2. Register on the cloud platform and get API Key
3. Use Python SDK or REST API

**Best for**:
- Quick integration into existing applications
- No infrastructure management
- Auto-scaling and high availability
